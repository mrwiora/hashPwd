hashPwd provides hashing algorithms within a classical windows form. Current Version: 1.0b

 Passwords are mostly kept simple to make them easy as possible to remember.
 This is okay, but a certain security issue - especially for passphrases (e.g. used for key-pairs).

 To bypass this issue it's possible to hash passphrases using hashing algorithms like MD5 (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5) or SHA1 (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA1).
 A password like "password" then will be 
 "5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99" (32-digit MD5) or
 "5baa61e4c9b93f3f0682250b6cf8331b7ee68fd8" (40-digit SHA1)
 While using this results it's possible to double them through the other algorithm.

 Further it's possible to combine a standard-password with a dynamic salt:
 "password" + "outlook.com" = "56217be90633ae4eee03bfbe3c7538bf" (MD5)
 "password" + "outlook.com" = "8fe821429e80caa0c65b2639826deb9ac6adabc7" (SHA1)

 hashPwd allows you to do this in a classic Windows Form.
